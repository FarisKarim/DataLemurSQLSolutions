Certainly! Here's the information without the solution:

Data Science Job Candidates
Problem Statement
You have a table of candidates and their skills. Your task is to find the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. Specifically, you want to identify candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

SQL Query
To accomplish this, you can use an SQL query that involves filtering, grouping, and counting:

sql
Copy code
-- Your SQL query goes here
Assumptions
There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output
candidate_id
123
The above output indicates that candidate 123 possesses all the required skills (Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL) and is best suited for the Data Science job. The result is sorted by candidate_id in ascending order.

Note: The actual SQL query has been removed, so you will need to write it yourself to find the candidates with the required skills. You can use the provided table as sample data for testing your query. Good luck!
